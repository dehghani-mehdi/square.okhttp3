# OkHttp3
 Xamarin Android binding for [Square OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/okhttp) (An HTTP+HTTP/2 client for Android and Java applications).

This project is based on [this repo](https://github.com/mattleibow/square-bindings), I'm using OkHttp3 in my projects, so I'll keep this repo up to date with [original (_java_) repo](https://github.com/square/okhttp).

## Usage
For now there is no Nuget package available, so you can download the `dll` file from `dist` folder, or clone the repo and build the solution and use the generated `dll`.

## Licenase
You need to pay 1000 million dollars for this or hit the __Star__ button :D
